# Supernodes - CR Regions Global Fund - Clarence Liu

All funds from our CR Regions Global Fund supernode are used to fund our regional teams 
and events that we believe will bring the most people to our community.

Our stake is graciously sponsored by Feng Han and the Manhattan Fund therefore we will update
our funding periodically, eventually if we have enough ELA we will host it ourselves, please be
patient as we work on transparency measures.
