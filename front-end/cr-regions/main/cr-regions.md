# Elastos - CR Regions

?> CR Regions are our presence in the real world and around the world.

Through our CR Regions initiative we empower each regional team to create their own
strategies to spread the goals and ideals of Elastos and Cyber Republic.

We believe this will bring exponential growth to the Elastos ecosystem, we'll do this
through meetups, events, workshops, happy hours, media and more. The goals of Elastos 
are a betterment to all, we believe in a future of data ownership, security and the right
to monetization and control our own data as we see fit.

### Vote for our Global Fund Supernode! Hosted by&nbsp;[Clarence Liu - VP of Development](/main/clarence-about.md)

All funds from our CR Regions Global Fund supernode are used to fund our regional teams 
and events that we believe will bring the most people to our community.

Although our CR Region Teams receive funding from Cyber Republic, our goal is to transition 
to be fully self-sufficient and self-funded. Therefore this and our other supernodes are
critical to our growth, if you have ELA follow this [voting guide](/main/voting-guide.md) to vote.
