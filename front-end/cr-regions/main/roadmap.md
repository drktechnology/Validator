# CR Regions - Roadmap

*Under Development*

## 2019 to Mid-2020 Strategic Principles

This first year will be a time to trial different strategies in each reason to determine which ones work the best for each region. It is important to keep in mind the following:

- Each CR Region has its own peculiarities and its own optimum strategy.

- Each CR Region should experiment with different strategies, their job is to not only carry out their “CR Proposal: Implementation Plan” but to review and improve their strategies.

- All CR Regions must be aware of changing trends in the blockchain space, no strategy will continue to work forever.
