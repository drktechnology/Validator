# Elastos Supernode Elections - How to Vote

### Why Vote?

Voting our supernodes helps us earn ELA and fund our projects! Eventually our CR Regions
wish to form a global network of teams that are all self-funded and can work to continually
grow the Elastos ecosystem.

## Getting Started - Download the Official Elastos Wallet

##### 1. Download the official Elastos Wallet that supports the Supernode Voting at&nbsp;[https://www.elastos.org/wallet](https://www.elastos.org/wallet)

!> Only download the wallet from our official&nbsp;[https://www.elastos.org](https://www.elastos.org) website!


##### 2. You vote with ELA so next you need to transfer the ELA you want to vote with to this wallet. 

?> Make sure you properly back up your mnemonic phrase and test it out before you send ELA there!

##### 3. Vote through the links shown below

1. Click the "Community" link at the bottom bar
